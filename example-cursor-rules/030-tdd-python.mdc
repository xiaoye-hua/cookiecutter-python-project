# Example: TDD Python Rule

When writing Python code, always follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

Use pytest for all tests and follow these conventions:
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Test functions should start with `test_`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
