# Example: Bug Fix TDD Rule

When fixing bugs in Python:

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (it should fail)
2. Fix the bug with minimal code changes
3. Verify the test now passes
4. Add additional tests for edge cases
5. Refactor if needed while keeping all tests passing

Always maintain high code coverage and document the fix.
